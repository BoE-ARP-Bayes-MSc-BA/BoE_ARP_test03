Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
(Starts Abruptly) four months ago and more rational when it comes to necessary rate
changes. I think I probably already commented on the Norwegian motor there. And then
ﬁnally forest ﬁres, it's a bit early that still -- a couple of them are still raging in Sweden, but
comparing to the large forest ﬁre we had in Sweden three years ago, roughly twice the
area has burned down and in that -- three years ago, we were nowhere near our
reinsurance protection if that gives you any guidance.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
There's been a ﬁgure mentioned in the Swedish press around SEK1 billion as kind of
potential losses, do you think that's a reasonable ﬁgure for the entire market?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
That would correspond well to the area comparison that I just gave, but then for individual
companies, how much they will get out of this, it will vary very much because it depends
on where the ﬁres have struck.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Exactly. Just a quick follow-up on the Swedish, you said small players are struggling. Why
is this?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Well, I think there are diﬀerent reasons for diﬀerent players, some of them have foreign
parents [ph] that have not been successful recently others have -- ﬁnd it diﬃcult to invest
as much in the modern technology as the big ones, for instance.

We'll now take a next question. Caller, please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Good afternoon, everyone. I've got three questions, please. First one is, ready to go back
on the -- on your exposure to the forest ﬁres. I think is it fair to say that your market share
in forest insurance is signiﬁcantly lower than the overall market share in Sweden? And -that's the ﬁrst question.
Secondly, I just wanted to know if you could remind us of where inﬂation is trucking in
your various markets and whether you're concerned at all that the weak Swedish kronor
might lead to some important inﬂation? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

Our market share in forest insurance is very low depending on exactly we're in the country
we're talking, but it's certainly less than 10% probably less than half that. Then inﬂation
was -- the Swedish krone has not exactly been strong for the past two years So we haven't
seen inﬂation picking up from that the Swedish RiksBank is hoping for that to happen, but
claims inﬂation is low in all our markets. It varies a bit. It is a little bit higher in motor in
Norway, but we're talking 2% to 3% overall.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Per Gronborg from SEB. Your line is open. Please
go ahead.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Per Gronborg from SEB. Two questions from my side. First on more being
a clariﬁcation, there were questions on capital and If P&C, is it fair to assume that your
dividend down towards the waiting [ph] basic requirement and have a modest margin
above that level going forward.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Yes, that's what we normally do and we have been even below that level. And as you can
see, we have close to EUR600 million of buﬀers already and we normally take the
dividend in December.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Okay. And my second session is on your bond portfolio, you stated bond yields
2.5% to 2.7% before currency hedges. Can you share with us new investments done
during the last quarters, what returns have they been done at, preferably of course
including the currency hedges, which I guess is taking down to return on euro-dollar
denominated investments build in If P&C and in Mandatum?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
I think many of the investments have been between -- yielding between 0% to 1%, but our
average yields are stated in our quarterly report. So it's 1.5 for If and 2.5 something for
Mandatum. And if you take away the currency hedges, I would say that they're both close
to 1.5. So that's the number you can use.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

That's -- your new investments are at the level of 1.5% excluding currency hedges in the
last quarter (inaudible).

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

The new investments, as we have not really changed our duration, the new investments
have been very low to very cash oriented. So I would say 0% to 1% for the new
investments, but there has not been that much maturing that it would aﬀect the total
running rate. So after currency hedges, you can use a number of 1.5 for both companies.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
We'll now take our next question Michael Huttner from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you. It's the second opportunity for me. So the ﬁrst one is the change in
management. You'll have a new Group CFO starting in January. And to me, it sounds like
the whole team of management team of Sampo is now about to renew, just wondered if
you can give us a bit of a ﬂavor of how you see it as the -- I guess would be asking the
currency, what's -- how you see that situation developing? What is the diﬀerence in kind of
style or how would you judge [ph] it, you might say it's not important, but I just see as they
do matter, they matter huge and you've been very successful. So it's important to us as
well.
And then the other question that was, I think a comment on large losses in private lines.
And I don't associate private lines with large losses, I was intrigued by that. I just
wondered if you could give a little bit more color on granularity on this? Thank you.

Okay. On change of management, Peter is sitting in front of me here in this room and I
don't want to insult him, but when he leaves, the whole management team is not
changing. It's only one still man. I see only one man in front of me. Even if he is super
competent and longer time, much appreciated colleague. Now, seriously speaking, this is
a people's business and I think that for every successful company, it's very important that
we have a good succession planning.
And actually we have. So every candidate, including myself, we have nominated success
or if something happens and we try to improve it, so that the newcomers are even better
than those who believe, not underestimating Peter or myself, but I think that life goes on
and why would we change to something if the new ones are not much better. So they -we raised the bar for them. So they have to deliver better numbers than we do. And Knut
Arne of course is a person whom we all know very well, because he is part of the team
already. And actually all our positions, I have a succession plan with internal candidates. I
think we are pretty unique in that when I have served on other boards of listed entities as
well. So our bench strength is really strong. And we think this is a people's business. So
you will just see at every time we change people, the team just getting stronger and
younger.

Bloomberg Transcript

How can I possibly follow this with something about large losses. So large losses private
lines Norway. We are not talking huge numbers here, but remember that 1% combined
ratio for the group in one quarter is EUR10 million. And have you seen Norwegian -Norwegian villas along the coastline, if you have a couple of those burning in one quarter,
you get the variation in the large loss frequency, and that's what we've seen in Q2.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. And may I ask a very quick follow-up question, I discussed with Anniina earlier and
I'm not so -- so I appreciate Sampo as the company, which is extremely disciplined in
terms of costs. One of the numbers -- it is the number at the bottom of the table on page
six, I think it is, shows the average number of FTEs rising by about 200 from 6,000 and a
bit to 6,000 and a bit of 200, which is a phenomenal company would not be much but for
companies disciplined Sampo surprised me a little bit. So I just wondered if you could
comment on that increase please?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
I think -- yes, this is the seasonal variation we always have more people in the summer
because of a number of factors we keep taking summer -- summer workers, et cetera.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) .

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
When we do grow this much, we also have to hire some more people. So that's a factor as
well, both [ph] in private lines.

We are of course extremely disciplined on cost. So there is no reason to doubt that would
change in any way.

FINAL

And I think that's I looked up the other day that we have been able to bring down the cost
ratio now for a decade in a row, every year. So we focus on that rather than the exact
number of employees, of course.
I didn't ask for you to ask this question, but it gives me the opportunity to say that the cost
ratio and expense ratio were best everywhere in If.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Excellent. Thank you very much.

We will now take our next question from Steven Haywood from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. And I wonder if you can give a few comments about
consolidation within the Nordic P&C markets. We've already seen some of your
competitors look to bulk up in Denmark and in Norway as well. Obviously, there is some
pressure on some of your peers as you say in Norway and potentially Sweden as well. So I
wonder if you can talk about Sampo or If willingness to takeover portfolios, businesses,
increase its market share and whether it's willing to pay out for these businesses or
whether it's willing to just maybe cut prices to take over others portfolios? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
Well, maybe I start, we probably have a little bit of a diﬀerent angle with Torbjorn. On
consolidation, we have the critical size to have scale beneﬁts and therefore our cost and
expense ratios are going down year-after-year. And Topdanmark is of course for us an
obvious target for consolidation. However, we have very clearly communicated that at
these levels of evaluation, we are not a buyer. So we develop the company, but it's a
consolidated -- if something unexpected happened and the valuation would be diﬀerent,
we would of course be interested in that company, but not at these valuations. Other
acquisition targets are not on my table, I don't know if you are Torbjorn and have any on
your table.
I think I'd rather answer that by saying that we are always asked to participate in
processes. As you mentioned that now and then there's a portfolio available in the market
and typically our benchmark is, of course, if we can grow organically at a cheaper rate
than buying a portfolio, it is -- the portfolios for sale are often not in optimal shape.
We are a proxy for you on M&A. So anything that moves in the Nordics is shown to us
because people know that we are quick decision makers and we have the capital. So we

will not miss any deal which is accretive [ph] or where we can create shareholder value.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Excellent. Okay. If I can just follow-up on your ﬁrst comment about Topdanmark and you
say that you're developing based on Topdanmark in Denmark. I believe you mentioned
this earlier this year as well. If you could provide some further comments on how you're
developing the relationship and how yo're working together maybe in partnership or
across diﬀerent P&C segments? And what you're doing in this business?

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
We are actually not working with that modus operandi at all we have allocated three of
our top management resources, i.e., Torbjorn Magnusson and CEO of If, Ricard
Wennerklint, Deputy CEO; and Petri Niemisvirta, the CEO of our Life Company to the
board. So it's a public released entity and we work fully transparently. As an owner, we are
of course one of the decision makers on board composition and we allocate the
resources I described and then we take it forward to that with transparent governance.

(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Blair Stewart from Bank of
America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Good afternoon. It is (inaudible) and apologies I missed the start of the call. I have two
questions. Torbjorn thank you for the color on the loss ratio development. You talked
about high one-oﬀ gains in the Swedish motors and ppl [ph] book, I just wondered what
was driving that if at all possible, was it individual cases or was it something else?
And secondly, just looking at the underlying result in the Life business. It was a little below
those of recent quarters. And I'm just really looking for a reason for that? Was it because
of the strong top line that came through or was it something else? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker
If I start with the Life company, there was slow real need to show higher result and we
cannot foresee inﬂuence that by choosing how much of the fair value reserve we realized
or the hidden [ph] values in our equity portfolio. So this was an adequate result for us.
We've burdened the result by lowering the discount rate from 2.75% to 2.5% for 2021 and
that costs EUR7 million.

And motor third-party, I'm afraid we're not diﬀerent from anyone else. So we see fewer
and fewer fatalities on the roads. We have performed a review of the reserves that led to a
release and that is no diﬀerent from any other company suite.

We'll take our next question from Michael Huttner from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Sorry, this is (inaudible) and since you have compared with other groups, I follow you
have a high ratio of debt to equity although your actual interest cost is slow as I've seen.
Can you give us a feel for how you look at leverage and -- certainly for some of your
peers, it's the number one objective to reduce leverage some of these peers (inaudible)
acquisitions recently and I'm just wondering where you see the kind of the optimum point
to how you judge it? Thank you.

A - Unidentiﬁed Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

But if you look at our leverage, we're actually right now approaching an average level of
debt, debt to equity in Sampo group. So, historically we've had very little leverage.
I think also that we communicated maybe a year ago that we would like to increase the
leverage in the parent. And why was that? Because we said that we don't really know
where to invest and then when we discarded all the areas where we don't want to invest,
we were left only we the equities and as it was diﬃcult to know where to invest and you
end up with equities. Then on the other hand, you knew one thing that you felt that this is
the moment to issue debt and our ﬁnancing cost at this moment, on average is -Roughly 80 basis points.
Yeah. So -- if our cost of debt is roughly 80 basis points, we felt that if we invest in equities
in general, that's not what we want to do when we leverage the group, but we want to
invest in the area of our specialty i.e., Nordic ﬁnancials and then we had the opportunity
to locate a few attractive investments during half year period, and now we have deployed
roughly 900 or not deployed the value of the investment at this moment is roughly 900
million.
So in that sense, that was deliberate decision to increase the leverage. You must
remember that we're still over capitalized. So our excess capital is roughly 3 billion. So if
there were more attractive opportunities, we could participate in something interesting.
But we haven't found anything which meet the very strict criteria that we have.
